# Diggin' Philly

The Digginâ€™ Philly project is a large and ambitious project to document black Philadelphia particularly against a backdrop of rapid urban change including massive gentrification. To accomplish this we have developed a Django based CMS that serves as a home to the project and provide access to a variety of content, including an interactive map.

## Getting Started

TODO: These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Python
2. Django
3. Install spatial libraries needed for GeoDjango ([detailed instructions can be found here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs/)).
    * Debian/Ubuntu only: `apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin`
    * GEOS
    * PROJ.4
    * GDAL
4. PostGres & PostGIS `apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgis libpq-dev`
5. Psycopg module: `pip install psycopg2`

*Note: You may have to add `/usr/local/lib` on a new line in `/etc/ld.so.conf` and then run `ldconfig` after each `make install`*

#### *Setting up Your Database*

```
$ su - postgres
$ psql
postgres=# create user [USER] password '[PASSWORD]';
postgres=# alter user [USER] with superuser;
postgres=# create database [DATABASE NAME] owner [USER];
postgres=# create extension postgis;
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
