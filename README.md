# Diggin' Philly

The Digginâ€™ Philly project is a large and ambitious project to document black Philadelphia particularly against a backdrop of rapid urban change including massive gentrification. To accomplish this we have developed a Django based CMS that serves as a home to the project and provide access to a variety of content, including an interactive map.
